Hence counting sort is among the fastest sorting algorithms around, in theory. The  particular distinction for counting sort is that it creates a bucket for each value and keep a counter in each bucket. Then each time a value is encountered in the input collection, the appropriate counter is incremented. Because counting sort creates a bucket for each value, an imposing restriction is that the maximum value in the input array be known beforehand.
